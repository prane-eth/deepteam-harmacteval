**DeepTeam** is a simple-to-use, open-source LLM red teaming framework for penetration testing and safeguarding large-language model systems. It is built on [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval), the open-source LLM evaluation framework.

DeepTeam incorporates the latest adversarial AI research to simulate attacks using SOTA techniques such as jailbreaking, prompt injection, and multi-turn exploitation, to uncover vulnerabilities like bias, PII leakage, and SQL injection that you might not otherwise catch. Whether your LLM system is an AI agent, RAG pipeline, chatbot, or just the LLM itself, DeepTeam helps you find security gaps — and then offers **guardrails** to prevent issues in production.

DeepTeam runs **locally on your machine** and uses LLMs for both attack simulation and evaluation during red teaming.

- 🏛️ Red team against established [AI safety frameworks](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/guidelines-and-frameworks) out-of-the-box. Each framework automatically maps its categories to the right vulnerabilities and attacks:
  - OWASP Top 10 for LLMs 2025
  - OWASP Top 10 for Agents 2026
  - NIST AI RMF
  - MITRE ATLAS
  - BeaverTails
  - Aegis
- 🛡️ 7 production-ready [guardrails](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/guardrails) for fast binary classification to guard LLM inputs and outputs in real time.
- 🧩 Build your own **custom vulnerabilities** and attacks that integrate seamlessly with DeepTeam's ecosystem.
- 🔗 Run red teaming from the **CLI** with YAML configs, or programmatically in Python.
- 📊 Access risk assessments, display in dataframes, and save locally in JSON.

&nbsp;

# 🚀 QuickStart

DeepTeam does not require you to define what LLM system you are red teaming — because neither will malicious users. All you need to do is install `deepteam`, define a `model_callback`, and you're good to go.

## Installation

```
pip install -U deepteam
```

## Red Team Your First LLM

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PromptInjection

async def model_callback(input: str) -> str:
    # Replace this with your LLM application
    return f"I'm sorry but I can't answer this: {input}"

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=[Bias(types=["race"])],
    attacks=[PromptInjection()]
)
```

Don't forget to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable before running (you can also use [any custom model](https://deepeval.com/guides/guides-using-custom-llms) supported in DeepEval), and run the file:

```bash
python red_team_llm.py
```

**That's it! Your first red team is complete.** Here's what happened:

- `model_callback` wraps your LLM system and generates a `str` output for a given `input`.
- At red teaming time, `deepteam` simulates a [`PromptInjection`](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks-prompt-injection) attack targeting [`Bias`](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-bias) vulnerabilities.
- Your `model_callback`'s outputs are evaluated using the `BiasMetric`, producing a binary score of 0 or 1.
- The final passing rate for `Bias` is determined by the proportion of scores that equal 1.

Unlike traditional evaluation, red teaming does not require a prepared dataset — adversarial attacks are dynamically generated based on the vulnerabilities you want to test for.

&nbsp;

## Red Team Against Safety Frameworks

Use established AI safety standards like OWASP and NIST instead of manually picking vulnerabilities:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10

async def model_callback(input: str) -> str:
    # Replace this with your LLM application
    return f"I'm sorry but I can't answer this: {input}"

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=model_callback,
    framework=OWASPTop10()
)
```

This automatically maps the framework's categories to the right vulnerabilities and attacks. Available frameworks include `OWASPTop10`, `OWASP_ASI_2026`, `NIST`, `MITRE`, `Aegis`, and `BeaverTails`.

&nbsp;

## Guard Your LLM in Production

Once you've found your vulnerabilities, use DeepTeam's guardrails to prevent them in production:

```python
from deepteam import Guardrails
from deepteam.guardrails import PromptInjectionGuard, ToxicityGuard, PrivacyGuard

guardrails = Guardrails(
    input_guards=[PromptInjectionGuard(), PrivacyGuard()],
    output_guards=[ToxicityGuard()]
)

# Guard inputs before they reach your LLM
input_result = guardrails.guard_input("Tell me how to hack a database")
print(input_result.breached)  # True

# Guard outputs before they reach your users
output_result = guardrails.guard_output(input="Hi", output="Here is some toxic content...")
print(output_result.breached)  # True
```

7 guards are available out-of-the-box: `ToxicityGuard`, `PromptInjectionGuard`, `PrivacyGuard`, `IllegalGuard`, `HallucinationGuard`, `TopicalGuard`, and `CybersecurityGuard`. [Read the full guardrails docs here.](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/guardrails)
